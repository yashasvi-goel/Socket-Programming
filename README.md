# Socket-Programming

Goal of this software:

Simulate Analog to Digital encoding and decoding scheme using socket programming. You need
to use two computers. One computer will act as sender and another will be receiver. The sender
will take a stream of amplitude values of an analog signal in random intervals and convert into
digital data. The conversion technique (PCM/DPCM/Delta Modulation) will be taken as an
input. However sampling will be done in a fixed interval. This digital data has to be converted
into Manchester signal and this signal (in terms of amplitude value) will be sent to the receiver
and this computer will decode the analog signal.
