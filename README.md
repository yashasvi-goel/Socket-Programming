# Socket-Programming

Goal of this software:

Simulate Analog to Digital encoding and decoding scheme using socket programming. You need
to use two computers. One computer will act as a sender and another will be the receiver. The sender
will take a stream of amplitude values of an analog signal in random intervals and convert it into
digital data. 
The conversion technique (PCM/DPCM/Delta Modulation) will be taken as an
input. However, sampling will be done in a fixed interval. This digital data has to be converted
into a Manchester signal and this signal (in terms of amplitude value) will be sent to the receiver
and this computer will decode the analog signal.
